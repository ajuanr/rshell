# rshell

This will be my submission for Assignment 2. The purpose of this project was to try and recreate the bash shell.

Some known __bugs__ for this project include:
* using 'test' or the symbolic operators [ ] on a relative filename with spaces causes a seg fault.
* multiple spaces between connectors causes seg faults
