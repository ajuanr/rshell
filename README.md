# rshell

This will be my submission for Assignment 2. The purpose of this project was to try and recreate the bash shell.

Some known __bugs__ for this project include:
* the connectors && and || don't work as intented.
* when using a shell script to test, __exit__ must be used as the last command or you get an infine loop.
