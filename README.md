# rshell

This will be my submission for Assignment 3. The purpose of this assignment was to try and recreate the bash shell. In this assignment, we were tasked with implementing the __test__ command as well as implemented order of precedence within the operators.

Some known __bugs__ for this project include:
* using 'test' or the symbolic operators [ ] on a relative filename with spaces causes a seg fault.
* multiple spaces between connectors causes seg faults
